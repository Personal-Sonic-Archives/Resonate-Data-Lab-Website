## Jordan's Sound Manifesto
- Sound is vibrations in matter...that connect that matter together.
- Sound is a medium for making: making meaning, making connections, making the familiar strange and the strange familiar.
- Sound is something you can tune into (or tune out of).
- Sound is always there, whether you are listening to it or not.
- Sound is now: Sound is happening in this moment. 
- Sound is in all directions at once. Sound also moves through you.
- (You can capture sound, sort of, but not the experience of listening?)
- Sound is a gulf and direct contact, at the same time.
- Sound invites us to wonder.
- Sound is always in flux. Sound is motion.
